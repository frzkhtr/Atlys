# **Task: ML Engineer**

Objective: As a Machine Learning Engineer, your task is to train a machine learning model based on your own research and expertise. Your goal is to choose the most suitable model.

### Dataset

The dataset to be used for this task is `midv_500`. It is essential to thoroughly familiarize yourself with this dataset before proceeding with the model training. Explore its features, investigate its target variables and understand its structure and content.

### Steps

1. **Data Analysis:** Start by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the `midv_500` dataset. This involves understanding the features, target variables, and overall structure of the data. Look at the distribution of data, summary statistics, and any other relevant information that helps you to understand the dataset better.
2. **Model Selection:** Based on your thorough understanding of the data and your own research, select an appropriate machine learning model. This decision should be based on the nature of the data, the problem to be solved, and the potential performance of various models. Your expertise in machine learning is key in this step, as your choice of model will significantly impact the results.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** After choosing a model, the next step is to clean, preprocess and augment the data.
4. **Train the Model:** Now that the data is ready, split it into a training set and a test set. It's important to ensure that the split is done in a way that the model is not biased and is able to generalize well from the training data to unseen data. Once the data is split, train the model using the training set.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using the test set. You may consider using cross-validation techniques for a more robust evaluation. Look at suitable performance metrics for your model and problem statement, and ensure that the model is not overfitting or underfitting.
6. **Optimization:** Based on the model's performance, you should consider tuning the hyperparameters or even trying different models.
7. **Documentation:** Lastly, make sure to document all the steps, decisions, and any observations made during the process. This documentation should be detailed enough to allow others to understand the choices made and the process followed. It will also be valuable for any future refinements or adjustments.
